**P.S.** is a music track written from scratch using the C programming language.
All sounds and notes were entered manually without using any music programs.
One single source file contains synth code, patterns and player.
No third party libraries are used except SDL2 to output the audio stream.

Usage:
* just play the song: `./ps`
* export to WAV: `./ps -o filename.wav`

How to make: just run one of the MAKE_* scripts (currently only Linux, but scripts for other systems will be added later too)
